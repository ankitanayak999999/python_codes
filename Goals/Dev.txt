This year, I strengthened my skills in Snowflake lineage features, IICS metadata extraction using Python, and SAP DS lineage automation using Python/XML, which helped reduce turnaround time for data analysis and improved transparency of data flows.

Next year, I plan to complete Snowflake Certification, expand automation frameworks for metadata and data quality, and share knowledge through mentoring and documentation to further support governance and faster decision-making
